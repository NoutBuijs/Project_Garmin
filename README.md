Project to map out my hiking journeys from my GPS device

The main issue I am facing now is that I cannot find a proper (free) method of retrieving contour lines.
As you can see, "routes_plotter_madrisa.py", I have found a way that works but it unfortunately takes a 
lot of effort, both exhaustive on my side as well as for the computer. Moreover, the .shp files are to 
large for a standard github repository.
 
I have found the contour lines to be essential for map interpretation especially their altitude labels, 
which is something the current (flawed) method does not do. Furthermore, the generated maps need details 
such as the mountain cabins I passed.
